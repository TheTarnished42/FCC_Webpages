                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>Some 20 years before the events of the game, Isshin Ashina wages a bloody coup against the Interior Ministry and wrestles back control of the land of Ashina by besting the enemy General Tamura in single combat.</p>
                    <p>Gifted with the sword, he was renowned as a Master Swordsman through his youth before honing his craft enough to be hailed as 'The Sword Saint'. And, this one man's title had enough weight to hold all enemies at bay, resulting in a period of peace for the people of Ashina.</p>
                    <p>Even with all his strength, Isshin was only a man after all, and by the start of the game, he had grown old. Sensing this, the land of Ashina was once more thrown into a turmoil facing a likely invasion by external forces. Isshin's successor-his adopted grandson Genichiro, hopes to combat the threat by relying on the powers of the Divine-heir. Isshin, not entirely supporting of this, helps the player who would face Genichiro in order to protect their master.</p>
                    <p>After the player defeats Genichiro, they meet the old Isshin who, after asking 'how strong his grandson was', thanks the player over sake and proceeds to guide them along their quest whilst imparting words of wisdom.</p>
                    <p>Should the player choose to betray their master and kill Emma, Isshin who was on his deathbed, gets up to face the player and declares "I must cut you down before you fall to Shura." </p>                
                    <p>Should the player choose to betray their father, they eventually find that Isshin dies of old age and sickness leading to an invasion by the Interior Ministry. However, upon winning the final battle against Genichiro, they find that Genichiro sacrifices himself with the "Open-Gate" Mortal blade and summons his grandfather, entrusting him with the wish to save Ashina. Isshin, back from the dead at his prime, declares that for him to fulfill his grandson's last wish, he must cut the player down as their actions would be opposing the wish.    </p>

                    <h2>Personality</h2>
                    <p>Besides his strength as a legendary warrior, Isshin was in many ways a charismatic leader. A great example of this would be him taking Gyoubu Oniwa, a former bandit-leader under his wing entrusting him as a defender of the ashina castle.</p>
                    <p>In his youth, regardless of the era he found himself in, there was no denying that Isshin was a warmonger; he fought desperately time and time again, polishing his technique in the blood of his enemies.
                        He consolidated his learnings under the "Ashina Style" name for the sake of his clan's dominance.
                        He would stop at nothing in his lust for power, and this single-minded search for strength ended in him taking Ashina for his own. </p>
                    <p>With age, Isshin's temperament had grown milder, his mind wiser and his skill with the blade even more honed. Despite his age and illness, he fights invading "rats" as the 'Tengu of Ashina'.</p>    
                    <p>Isshin was a man who loved sake. Should the player gift it to him, he would reminisce about old times, informing the player of the details of past.</p>    
                    <p>Perhaps the most significant impact he would have on player is when he advises the player on the nature of conflict and quotes his iconic line, "Hesitation is Defeat"; which besides being applicable in all aspects of life in general, it is especially remembered when the player faces Isshin at the end- if the player backs away either out of fear or to gain distance, they would find themselves made quick-work-of by Isshin and unless the player attacks steadily, Isshin becomes nigh impossible to defeat.</p>
                    <p>In the ending where the player doesnot betray their master, upon defeating Isshin, he would say "Well done!" and accepts his death, acknowledging the player's skill.</p>

                    <h2>Skills</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h3>In his Youth</h3>
                            <p>As a master of the blade, he had developed <b>'The Ashina Style'</b>, whose essence, in his words boiled down to <i>"Win..., just win!"</i>. The style mainly dealed with efficient deflection of attacks, stronger counter-attacks and devastating blows to the enemies posture. Prominent moves are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><span>Double Ichimonji</span>: Ichimonji delivers a heavy, one-hit overhead sword strike. Deals high posture damage and also recovers one's own posture with a strong forward step. Single-minded mastery of this technique is the heart of the Ashina style's strength.  The follow-up attack(the double) is especially useful for preventing enemy counterattacks. Ashina's Ichimonji is perfected with this follow-up strike.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li><span>Ashina Cross</span> From a sheathed stance, draw the blade at high speed. A secret technique of the Ashina style, devoted to the mastery of a swift kill. Draws a cruciform cut in the blink of an eye; so fast it could sever the arm of Shura, or so boasts Isshin Ashina.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li><span>Dragon Flash</span>: Combat Art that performs a high-speed cut from a sheathed stance and could send out shockwaves. In his younger years, Isshin was a devil with the sword, spending his days in pursuit of life-or-death combat. He often ruminated on how a cut should be made, but his blade always moved first.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h3>In his old age</h3>
                            <p>The elderly Isshin was akin to a sharpened blade. His steadily honed techniques culminated in the Ashina Style, soundly eliminating all wasted or idle movement. A master who took the spirit of his craft to its pinnacle; a true sword saint. His methodical act of improving his techniques of old lead to the birth of his esoteric art, taking name from its creator:</p>
                            <ul><li><span>One mind</span>: A Combat Art that unleashes a storm of attacks from the sheathed stance; so fast the blade is nigh invisible. One must focus their soul on the release of the blade, nothing else. Through that focus, the strikes achieve a god-like speed. Only one as honed as the aging Isshin Ashina could perform this technique. </li></ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h3>Summoned Isshin</h3>
                            <p>One who returns from the great beyond does so at the peak of their prosperity. In addition to all of the above skills, Isshin wield not one, not two, but three weapons in the final battle against the player.
                               With the black Mortal blade that can send out devastating unstoppable attacks in one hand, General Tamura's spear that bombards the player with continuous heavy blows, in another, he also uses a flintlock pistol to punish the player should they intend to gain distance.       
                            </p>
                            <p>In the fight, Isshin's skill is showcased to the point where he is able to catch lightning mid-air and use it against the player.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In the end, Isshin coveted strength and all manner of techniques throughout his mortal struggle. He wished for war until his final hour, and that is precisely what he got.</p>
